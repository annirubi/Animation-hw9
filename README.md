# ANIMATION â˜€
There is a page with animation features.
Here is the link:
[My project] (annirubi.github.io/animation-hw9/). 

Properties and functions used for animation:
- [X] transform: rotate
- [X] transition
- [X] animation
- [X] @keyframes

The header is hidden but hovering its border it appears. 

The section with images was also animated. Hovering the image it starts to rotate (180deg).

The section with blocks is animated as well with infinite animation, blocks change their shape and color while rotating.



This page was created using **html** and **css**. 

The page is adaptive, I used dispaly:flex, flex-wrap, justify-content and align-items.
